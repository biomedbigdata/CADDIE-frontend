          <p>
            CADDIE (Cancer Driver Drug Interaction Explorer) is a resource to
            repurpose drugs in cancer based on gene-gene and drug-gene
            interaction networks. The user has the option to choose between the
            implemented interaction networks from STRING, BioGRID, DrugBank,
            ChEMBL and more. CADDIE then exploits the information in selected
            networks using network algorithms like Trustrank or Degree
            Centrality. The algorithms and the desired parameters are again
            customizable by the user. Doing this, CADDIE is able to identify
            drug repurposing candidates or to search for putative drug targets.
          </p>
          <a id="documentation-workflow"></a>
          <h4 class="title is-4">Workflow</h4>
          <p>The main steps of working with CADDIE are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pick your cancer type of interest</li>
            <li>Select the gene-interaction database of your choice</li>
            <li>
              Find
              <a href="documentation#documentation-seed-genes">seed genes</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Start a drug-target or drug search using one of the implemented
              <a href="documentation#documentation-algorithms">algorithms</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Visualize the results and download them for further processing
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Variations of this workflow are of course possible, for example you
            have the option to upload your own list of
            <a href="documentation#documentation-seed-genes">seed genes</a> or
            to find
            <a href="documentation#documentation-seed-genes">seed genes</a>
            based on related diseases. In general, CADDIE facilitates the seed
            selection process with a variety of different types of implemented
            information.
          </p>

          <a id="documentation-seed-genes"></a>

          <h4 class="title is-4">Seed genes</h4>
          <p>
            Seed genes are the starting genes for the algorithms. All
            implemented algorithms search in the interaction network for
            drug-targets or drugs based on their relation the the seed genes.
            Therefore, the seed genes are your genes of interest for which
            putative drugs or drug-target candidates should be found for.
          </p>

          <a id="documentation-algorithms"></a>

          <h4 class="title is-4">Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            CADDIE comes with algorithms for both drug-target identification and
            drug candidate search. Drug-target algorithms give you the
            possibility to find hub genes in the human gene-interaction network
            that are central to your seed genes. They also can be a helpful
            preprocessing step for your drug search. We implemented
            <b>6 different drug-target search algorithms in CADDIE</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Mutli-Steiner Tree:</b> The Multi-level Steiner tree algorithm
              is used to approximate the minimum spanning tree spanned by the
              seed nodes in reasonable time. The implementation is adopted from
              <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02627" target="_blank"
                >Ahmed et al.</a
              >
              It can be used to create a minimum spanning subnetwork between
              user-selected seed nodes, which happen to be central interaction
              partners between the seed nodes, and thus represent favorable
              drug-targets.
            </li>

                target="_blank"
                ><b>KeyPathwayMiner:</b></a
              >
              KeyPathwayMiner (KPM) is an online tool developed by
              <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/W1/W98/2499355"
                target="_blank"
                >Alcaraz et al.</a
              >
              for pathway enrichment analysis. Users have the option to utilize
              KPM for their drug-target search by selecting seed nodes in the
              GGI network and letting KPM find an interaction network of genes
              that are commonly dysregulated spanned by the seed genes. The
              resulting proteins are presumably functionally related to the seed
              nodes, and therefore are suitable drug-target candidates. Only one
              parameter K has to be set by the user which defines the amount of
              permitted intermediate nodes that are neither part of the seed
              nodes nor the common pathway.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TrustRank: </b> TrustRank is based on the same concepts as the
              <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/" target="_blank"
                >Google PageRank algorithm</a
              >
              and Closeness Centrality. A crawler searches the network based on
              user-selected seeds and ranks visited nodes, damping the score
              based on the distance traveled. The damping factor can be set by
              the user in a range from 0-1, with a higher damping factor causing
              the crawler to explore nodes in close proximity or in larger
              portions of the GGI network. In CADDIE, TrustRank is able to find
              putative drug targets as well as drug candidates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Degree Centrality:</b> Degree centrality measurement is
              obtained by ranking the nodes in a network based on their degree,
              which is defined as the number of neighbors a node has divided by
              the number of nodes. Its normalized form, which is implemented in
              CADDIE, can be described as
              <div class="documentation-formula">
                <i>centrality<sub>degree</sub>(x) = deg(x) / n âˆ’ 1</i>
              </div>
              where x is a given node and deg(x) is its degree. While it is a
              <a
                href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21575741/"
                target="_blank"
                >commonly used network analysis technique</a
              >, it most importantly has been shown useful in the
              <a
                href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26355787/"
                target="_blank"
                >identification of essential proteins in PPI networks</a
              >. Thus, it is a simple approach to classifying the
              network-related importance of a particular protein. In CADDIE it
              can be used to discover valuable drug-targets or drugs, based on
              the seed selection given by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Harmonic Centrality:</b> Harmonic centrality measurement can be
              described as the average shortest distance from each node to all
              other nodes in a network. This measurement is the equivalent of
              closeness centrality for disconnected graphs. For comparable
              results, the normalized version was used. Formally speaking, it
              can be annotated as

              <div class="documentation-formula">
                <i>centrality<sub>harmonic</sub>(x) = </i>&sum;<sub
                  >y&#x2260;x</sub
                ><sup>y</sup>( (n âˆ’ 1) / dist(x, y) )
              </div>

              where x is a given node and n âˆ’ 1/dist(x, y) = 0 if dist(x, y) = âˆž
              (<a
                href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Closeness-Centrality-Extended-to-Unconnected-the-Rochat/a4ea7b92421415674c6ed954914f0512935d0dfb"

              has already been proven successful in a number of biological
              network problems for instance with
              <a

                >metabolic</a
              >
              or
              <a

                >PPI networks</a
              >
              . In CADDIE, this algorithm can be used to find drug targets or
              drugs that affect the seed nodes as direct as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Betweenness Centrality:</b> Betweenness is obtained by finding
              the shortest paths for each pair of nodes in the network and
              assessing the number of shortest paths that pass through a
              particular node, such that a measure of the centrality of a node
              in a network global context is received. Betweenness Centrality
              has been established as a common measurement in
              <a
                href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-7-219"

                >finding communities in large networks</a
              >. In CADDIE, betweenness is based on the shortest paths between
              the seed nodes only and can be used to find drug targets with
              maximized connectivity to all seeds.

              expectation. This algorithm was adopted in CADDIE so that
              best-scored drugs are returned to the user as candidate drugs.

            Below the network you can find various functions that help you to
            manipulate the network to find genes of your interest. The
            expression of genes in different tissues (data from GTEx) as well as
            in different cancer types (data from TCGA) can be highlighted and
            genes may be selected automatically above a certain threshold. The
            same possibility exists for mutation data from TCGA. Furthermore, a
            menu is available with versatile options such as selection of all
            cancer driver genes or upload of a vcf-file to filter for genes with
            damaging mutations.
            <br />
            You can add your own genes to the network by uploading your own seed
            genes (for example via the 'Custom genes' function in the left menu)
            followed by the 'Add to network' functionality. Gene-gene
            interactions are taken from the selected interaction database.

          <h4 class="title is-5">Analysis View</h4>
          <p>
            THe analysis view opens when you click on a finished task in the
            left menu in the explorer. The analysis view will open on top of the
            network, and is divided in four parts. One part is the result
            network, which offers the same functions as the initial gene-network
            but here it displays all
            <a href="documentation#documentation-seed-genes">seed genes</a> in
            combination with the found genes and/or drugs and allows you to
            inspect the relations from the seeds to the results. Your can also
            look at your results in a table format, where additional information
            to each of the genes or drugs is displayed. Here you can sort the
            nodes to get a better overview and download the tables for further
            processing on your side. Furthermore, CADDIE also provides different
            statistics and graphs about the analysis (depending on your analysis
            parameters). For example, you can set the calculated score for each
            of your genes and drugs in comparison to the node degrees in the
            drug-gene interactome (see below). Ultimately, the selected
            parameters and versions of the used datasets can be retrieved in the
            fourth tab.

          <h4 class="title is-4">Drug Interaction Lookup</h4>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="/drug-lookup" target="_blank">drug interaction lookup</a>
            enables you to inspect the interaction datasets in respect to
            individual drugs. If the searched drug is not found in the database,
            the drug with the closest matching name will be shown.
            <br />
            All interacting genes based on the selected drug-gene interaction
            dataset will be listed. Cancer driver genes for any cancer type in
            the CADDIE database will be highlighted.

            The
            <a href="/gene-lookup" target="_blank">gene interaction lookup</a>
            works similar to the
            <a href="/documentation#documentation_drug_interaction_lookup"
              >drug interaction lookup</a
            >
            with the difference that that it allows you to search for genes
            instead of drugs. The list of drug interactions will be shown along
            with detailed drug information. In addition, you will receive a list
            of all known cancer types related to your gene of interest.
